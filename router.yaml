  # It does not have any path section, so no trailing slash.

  allow_credentials: false

  # The headers to allow.
  # Not setting this mirrors a client's received `access-control-request-headers`
  # This is equivalent to allowing any headers,
  # except it will also work if allow_credentials is set to true
